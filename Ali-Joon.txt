Hi, My name is Ali. I'm just a regular person on the internet doing his stuff. You can just find me on <span id="c">Discord</span>, I'm not active in other places.
Contributing to community projects is my passion, especially localizing and translating. You give my <span id="c">Crowdin profile</span> a visit to see a list of my contribution.
I like to give a hand to people who have the potential to get somewhere but need a little bit of help. Two of the examples of them are a YouTuber <span id="c">Lyon S.P.D</span> &amp; the <span id="c">Crafty team</span> for their website.
Needless to say, your boy is an average Minecraft enjoyer and a fellow Engi-main in cp_dustbowl. Just take a look at <span id="c">my Steam profile!</span>
Want to know me more? then let's be friends!
