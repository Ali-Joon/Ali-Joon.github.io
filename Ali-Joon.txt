<p>Hi, My name is Ali. I'm just a regular person on the internet doing his stuff. You can just find me on Discord, I'm not active in other places.</p>
<p>Contributing to community projects is my passion, especially localizing and translating. You give my Crowdin Profile a visit to see a list of my contribution.</p>
<p>I like to give a hand to people who have the potential to get somewhere but need a little bit of help. Two of the examples of them are a YouTuber Lyon S.P.D &amp; the Crafty team for their website.</p>
<p>Needless to say, your boy is an average Minecraft enjoyer and a fellow Engineer in cp_dustbowl. Just take a look at my Steam profile!</p>
<p>Want to know me more? then let's be friends!</p>
<p>Ronald, it's been 5 months and you still owe me a premium...</p>
